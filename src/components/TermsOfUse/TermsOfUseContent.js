        <b>Third Party Materials</b>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The Service may require, enable or facilitate access to or use of
            software or services of a third party (<b>&#34;Third Party&#34;</b>
            ). In such an event, there may be terms of use of the third party
            software or service (the <b>&#34;Third Party Terms&#34;</b>).
            GovTech may be required under or as a result of the Third Party
            Terms to notify you of certain terms that apply to you (either
            directly as an end user, or as a party whose acts or omissions could
            cause GovTech to breach the Third Party Terms) when you use the
            Services. An example of Third Party Terms may be open source
            software terms or standard form terms of the distribution platform
            from which you obtain any part of the Service (e.g. Google Play
            Store or Apple App Store terms) which bind GovTech as a developer or
            user of the distribution platform (the{" "}
            <b>&#34;Distribution Terms&#34;</b>). Information on the Third Party
            Terms are embedded in the Service, already accounted for in these
            Terms of Use, publicly available (e.g the Distribution Terms) or
            otherwise listed in the Schedule herein. For the avoidance of doubt,
            insofar as this Clause 4 relates to the Distribution Terms, the
            relevant Distribution Terms are the terms of the specific platform
            from which you obtained a copy of the software or application that
            is part of the Service. For example, if you obtained the said copy
            from the Google Play Store, then the relevant terms are Google’s
            Distribution Terms.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is your responsibility to check and read the most up-to-date
            versions of these Third Party Terms and you are deemed to have
            notice of the same. In particular, you are deemed to have notice of
            the Third Party Terms that GovTech (under the Third Party Terms) is
            required to notify you, and you unconditionally agree to be bound by
            all the obligations in the Third Party Terms which are applicable to
            you as the end user.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the Third Party Terms require you to enter into an agreement
            directly with the Third Party, then you unconditionally agree to
            enter into such agreement, and in any event, to be legally bound by
            the Third Party Terms. For the avoidance of doubt:
            <ol>
              <li>
                some Third Party Terms (particularly open-source terms) permit
                either a direct licence to you from the Third Party or a
                sublicence from GovTech to you. In such cases, your licence is a
                direct licence from the Third Party to you; and
              </li>
              <li>
                the terms of your agreement with the Third Party will govern
                your use of the relevant third party software or service, and
                not these Terms of Use.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            If the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require GovTech to
            incorporate certain terms in these Terms of Use (inclusive of terms
            which impose any minimum or maximum standards herein, and/or terms
            described in Clause 4.5 below), such terms are deemed to have been
            so incorporated (the <b>&#34;Incorporated Terms&#34;</b>). Examples
            of Incorporated Terms include provisions which require GovTech to
            give you notice of certain rights and liabilities or require GovTech
            to ensure that you acknowledge certain matters. Similarly, if the
            Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require these Terms of Use
            to be altered such that the Third Party Terms are complied with, the
            parties herein agree that the Terms of Use shall be deemed to be so
            altered but only to the extent necessary for compliance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some Third Party Terms grant the Third Party, or require GovTech to
            grant the Third Party, direct rights of enforcement of these Terms
            of Use as a third party beneficiary, against you. Such Third Party
            Terms are deemed to have been incorporated into these Terms of Use
            as Incorporated Terms, and you hereby agree to grant such Third
            Party, such direct rights of enforcement against you.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the avoidance of doubt, without prejudice to Clause 4.4, to the
            extent of any inconsistency between these Terms of Use and the Third
            Party Terms, the latter shall prevail provided nothing in the Third
            Party Terms increases the liability of GovTech beyond that stated in
            Clause 6.

        <b>Your Consent to Access Functions of Your Device</b>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Use of the Service may require you to allow access by the Service to
            certain functions of your device, such as push notifications, the
            obtaining and/or sharing of your location, or the collection of data
            from you in connection with the Service. Please also see clause 8
            (Privacy Policy). Your use of the Service shall constitute your
            consent to the access by the Service of such functions of your
            device as may be reasonably required by the Service.

            extent permitted by law, GovTech does not make any representations

            including but not limited to any direct or indirect, special or

            GovTech may, at its sole discretion, refer any dispute referred to
            in clause 11.2 above to arbitration administered by the Singapore
            International Arbitration Centre (<b>&#34;SIAC&#34;</b>) in
            Singapore in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the SIAC (
            <b>&#34;SIAC Rules&#34;</b>) for the time being in force, which
            rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause.
            Further:
            <ol>
              <li>The seat of the arbitration shall be Singapore.</li>

              <li>The language of the arbitration shall be English.</li>
              <li>
                All information, pleadings, documents, evidence and all matters
                relating to the arbitration shall be confidential.
              </li>
            </ol>
            Where GovTech is the defendant or respondent, it shall be given at
            least 30 days before the commencement of any legal action against it
            to elect to exercise the right herein to have the dispute submitted
            to arbitration. This right to elect shall not prejudice GovTech’s
            right to a limitation defence and the period to exercise the right

            defence in favour of GovTech during the said period.
