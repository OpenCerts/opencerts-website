                  The Service may require, enable or facilitate access to or use of software or services of a third
                  party (<b>Third Party</b>
                  ). In such an event, there may be terms of use of the third party software or service (the{" "}
                  <b>Third Party Terms</b>). GovTech may be required under or as a result of the Third Party Terms to
                  notify you of certain terms that apply to you (either directly as an end user, or as a party whose
                  acts or omissions could cause GovTech to breach the Third Party Terms) when you use the Services. An
                  example of Third Party Terms may be open source software terms or standard form terms of the
                  distribution platform from which you obtain any part of the Service (e.g. Google Play Store or Apple
                  App Store terms) which bind GovTech as a developer or user of the distribution platform (the{" "}
                  <b>Distribution Terms</b>). Information on the Third Party Terms are embedded in the Service, already
                  accounted for in these Terms of Use, publicly available (e.g the Distribution Terms) or otherwise
                  listed in the Schedule herein. For the avoidance of doubt, insofar as this Clause 4 relates to the
                  Distribution Terms, the relevant Distribution Terms are the terms of the specific platform from which
                  you obtained a copy of the software or application that is part of the Service. For example, if you
                  obtained the said copy from the Google Play Store, then the relevant terms are Google’s Distribution
                  Terms.

                  Third Party Terms that GovTech (under the Third Party Terms) is required to notify you, and you
                  unconditionally agree to be bound by all the obligations in the Third Party Terms which are applicable

                      some Third Party Terms (particularly open-source terms) permit either a direct licence to you from
                      the Third Party or a sublicence from GovTech to you. In such cases, your licence is a direct

                      the terms of your agreement with the Third Party will govern your use of the relevant third party

                  If the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require GovTech to incorporate certain terms in these
                  Terms of Use (inclusive of terms which impose any minimum or maximum standards herein, and/or terms
                  described in Clause 4.5 below), such terms are deemed to have been so incorporated (the{" "}
                  <b>Incorporated Terms</b>). Examples of Incorporated Terms include provisions which require GovTech to
                  give you notice of certain rights and liabilities or require GovTech to ensure that you acknowledge
                  certain matters. Similarly, if the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require these Terms of Use
                  to be altered such that the Third Party Terms are complied with, the parties herein agree that the
                  Terms of Use shall be deemed to be so altered but only to the extent necessary for compliance.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Some Third Party Terms grant the Third Party, or require GovTech to grant the Third Party, direct
                  rights of enforcement of these Terms of Use as a third party beneficiary, against you. Such Third
                  Party Terms are deemed to have been incorporated into these Terms of Use as Incorporated Terms, and
                  you hereby agree to grant such Third Party, such direct rights of enforcement against you.

                  For the avoidance of doubt, without prejudice to Clause 4.4, to the extent of any inconsistency
                  between these Terms of Use and the Third Party Terms, the latter shall prevail provided nothing in the
                  Third Party Terms increases the liability of GovTech beyond that stated in Clause 6.
