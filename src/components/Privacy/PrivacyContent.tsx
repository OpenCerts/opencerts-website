        <p>
          This Privacy Policy must be read in conjunction with the Terms of Use that accompany the applicable service
          you are requesting from us (the &#34;Service&#34;). In this Privacy Policy, &#34;Public Sector Entities&#34;
          means the Government (including its ministries, departments and organs of state) and public authorities (such
          as statutory boards).
        </p>
        <p>Insofar as the Service consists of or is provided to you through a website, please note that:</p>
        <p>
          <b>2.1.</b> We may use &#34;cookies&#34;, where a small data file is sent to your browser to store and track
          information about you when you enter our websites. The cookie is used to track information such as the number
          of users and their frequency of use, profiles of users and their preferred sites. While this cookie can tell
          us when you enter our sites and which pages you visit, it cannot read data off your hard disk.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2.2.</b> You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but
          you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking
          full advantage of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may request certain types of data from you in connection with your access or use of the Service. The data
          that may be requested include those identified in the Annex herein. Your data may be stored in our servers,
          systems or devices, in the servers, systems or devices of our third party service providers or collaborators,
          or on your device, and may be used by us or our third party service providers or collaborators to facilitate
          your access or use of the Service. We or our third party service providers or collaborators may collect system
          configuration information and/or traffic information (such as an IP address) and/or use information or
          statistical information to operate, maintain or improve the Services or the underlying service of the third
          party service provider or collaborator. For the avoidance of doubt, in this Privacy Policy, a reference to a
          third party service provider or collaborator includes other third parties who provide a service or collaborate
          with our third party service provider or collaborator.
        </p>
        <p>If you provide us with personally identifiable data:</p>
        <p>We may use, disclose and process the data for any one or more of the following purposes:</p>

          any other Public Sector Entity or third party service provider or collaborator, and whether for your own
          benefit, or for the benefit of a third party on whose behalf you are duly authorised to act;
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>4.3.</b> to carry out your instructions or respond to any queries, feedback or complaints provided by (or
          purported to be provided by) you or on your behalf, or otherwise for the purposes of responding to or dealing
          with your interactions with us;
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>4.4.</b> to monitor and track your usage of the Service or our websites, to conduct research, data

          interests, concerns and preferences and improving the Service (including any service of a third party service
          provider or collaborator) and other services and products provided by Public Sector Entities. For the
          avoidance of doubt, we may also collect, use, disclose and process such information to create reports and
          produce statistics regarding your transactions with us and your usage of the Services and other services and
          products provided by Public Sector Entities for record-keeping and reporting or publication purposes (whether
          internally or externally);

          We may share necessary data with other Public Sector Entities, and third party service providers in connection

          sharing is prohibited by law. We will not share your personal data with entities which are not Public Sector
          Entities, except where such sharing is necessary for such entities to assist us in providing the Service to
          you or for fulfilling any of the purposes herein.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that we may be required to disclose your data by law, including any law governing the
          use/provision of any service of a third party service provider or collaborator.

          To safeguard your personal data, all electronic storage and transmission of personal data is secured with
          appropriate security technologies.

        <p>
          You may withdraw your consent to the use and disclosure of your data by us with reasonable notice and subject
          to any prevailing legal or contractual restrictions; however, doing so may prevent the proper functioning of
          the Service and may also result in the cessation of the Service to you.
