          This Privacy Policy must be read in conjunction with the Terms of Use that accompany the applicable service
          you are requesting from us (the &#34;Service&#34;). In this Privacy Policy, &#34;Public Sector Entities&#34;
          means the Government (including its ministries, departments and organs of state) and public authorities (such
          as statutory boards).

                  We may use &#34;cookies &#34;, where a small data file is sent to your browser to store and track
                  information about you when you enter our websites. The cookie is used to track information such as the
                  number of users and their frequency of use, profiles of users and their preferred sites. While this
                  cookie can tell us when you enter our sites and which pages you visit, it cannot read data off your
                  hard disk.

                  You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you
                  can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from
                  taking full advantage of the website.

              servers, systems or devices, in the servers, systems or devices of our third party service providers or
              collaborators, or on your device, and may be used by us or our third party service providers or
              collaborators to facilitate your access or use of the Service. We or our third party service providers or
              collaborators may collect system configuration information and/or traffic information (such as an IP
              address) and/or use information or statistical information to operate, maintain or improve the Services or
              the underlying service of the third party service provider or collaborator. For the avoidance of doubt, in
              this Privacy Policy, a reference to a third party service provider or collaborator includes other third
              parties who provide a service or collaborate with our third party service provider or collaborator.
